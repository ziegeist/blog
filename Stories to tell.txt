Stories to tell

Do I actually have any stories to tell about Uncle Wai? Most of my stories are pretty boring, I think Mom would have a better stories. I’ve been pretty segregated from all the crazy things. I should just ask her to time me some stories and right them.


The Fall CY Leung

CY Leung is not longer running for  chief executive of Hong Kong. This is not really surprising given how unpopular he is. Beijing usually chooses the most popular option… because choosing an unpopular option just makes things that much harder. Therefore, it isn’t really surprising that CY is not running for re-election. Even though he says that family is his reason for not running, I’m pretty confident that Beijing told him not to run. Beijing wants a more popular candidate to win and they also don’t want him to split votes. I also think that Beijing wants to save face… and CY losing about a lot will not be go for their ego.
