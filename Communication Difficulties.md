# Communication Difficulties

Communication is fucking hard.
People bring their own baggage into a conversation. Sometimes you think that people understand what you are saying, but after a few days you realize that they have completely missed the point. It would be great if they ask for an explanation if they don't understand, but sometimes people won't ask... That makes things way more complicated.Â 
You also have to empathetic to the other party... but it becomes increasingly more difficult if the other side doesn't think about it from your point of view as well.
Communication is hard especially if you are trying to maintain an amicable relationship with the other party. There are sensitive topics to avoid, and you do not want to offend anybody.
It gets more difficult if the other side just shuts down, and you get frustrated and you want to yell, but yelling will cause the other side to shut down even more. It's a never ending cycle.
